During the first week, I met with Dr. Crawford and my mentors to discuss the project 
that I will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Crawford will be looking for. 
Dr. Crawford also explained to me what, "Physiological Computing Education", is along 
with the differences between EEG and EMG.
